Q1. Sorting Names [4pts]

We are having 100 names (full name) in an array which we are intending to sorting either in ascending or descending order. The user will be required to enter from the keyboard (asc for ascending order desc for ascending order).
Task 1: You are having a function pointer that will be taking the array of names and a callback function that will be used to sort names in the chosen order.

Task 2: You are having a second function will count the number of names in an array 

Task 3: You will need to have an array of functions such that if the user chooses 1 for function 1 and 2 for function 2.

To test the program, run download and run the sort file in a linux environment.
