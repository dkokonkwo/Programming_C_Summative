Q4. Data Storage and Computation [4pts]

We have a class of n students (5<n<100) for every student we are recording their grades for 3 courses (Programming in C, Mobile Application Development, and Communications). We are required to use structures to present students. For every student, we are considering full name and grades (/100) for each course the student took.

The user will be entering all these details from the keyboard and store them in a file on the hard disk (same folder as the program to be executed). Data for each student will be recorded on each respective row.

Run the "sys_log" file in a linux environment to test the program.
