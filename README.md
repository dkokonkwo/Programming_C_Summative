Q1. Sorting Names [4pts]

We are having 100 names (full name) in an array which we are intending to sorting either in ascending or descending order. The user will be required to enter from the keyboard (asc for ascending order desc for ascending order).

Task 1: You are having a function pointer that will be taking the array of names and a callback function that will be used to sort names in the chosen order.

Task 2: You are having a second function will count the number of names in an array 

Task 3: You will need to have an array of functions such that if the user chooses 1 for function 1 and 2 for function 2.

 

Q2. Remote for Light [5pts]

We are having a light bulb in our house that we would like to control using the remote control

You will design a circuit that has a light bulb and components needed to make it light (power source, relay, bulb, resistors, arduino board, sensors, remote control). Once the design is in place, you will write a program that makes the circuit achieves its functionalities.

Q3. Multithreads [4Pts]

We have the sum of n numbers that we would like to compute using 10 threads (array of threads). Given n as a number greater 1000 that will be entered from the keyboard. Each thread will be handling (n/10) elements. For example if n is 1000, each thread will compute 100 elements, after each thread has its sum all the sums will be added up together to the total sum.

Q4. Data Storage and Computation [4pts]

We have a class of n students (5<n<100) for every student we are recording their grades for 3 courses (Programming in C, Mobile Application Development, and Communications). We are required to use structures to present students. For every student, we are considering full name and grades (/100) for each course the student took.

The user will be entering all these details from the keyboard and store them in a file on the hard disk (same folder as the program to be executed). Data for each student will be recorded on each respective row.

Q5. System Performance [3pts]

We are having an interest in keeping track of system performance (CPU usage % and Memory usage %) every two seconds. You are required to write a bash script that keeps listening to system performance and log it in a file  every 2 seconds.
