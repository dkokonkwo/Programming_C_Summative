Q3. Multithreads [4Pts]

We have the sum of n numbers that we would like to compute using 10 threads (array of threads). Given n as a number greater 1000 that will be entered from the keyboard. Each thread will be handling (n/10) elements. For example if n is 1000, each thread will compute 100 elements, after each thread has its sum all the sums will be added up together to the total sum.

Run the "sum" file in a linux environment to test the program.
